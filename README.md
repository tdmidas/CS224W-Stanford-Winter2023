# CS224W - Machine Learning with Graphs (Stanford)

This repository contains resources of my learning for the CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs course at Stanford.

## Colab Resources

The `colab_resources` folder contains Jupyter Notebook files with code examples, exercises, and solutions that you can run on Google Colab. These resources are designed to help you understand and implement various concepts covered in the course.

### Usage

1. Open the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) website.
2. Navigate to the `colab_resources` folder.
3. Open the desired notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Colab.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook.

## Course Slides

The `course_slides` folder contains lecture slides from the CS224W course. These slides provide an overview of the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning with graphs.

### Topics Covered

- Graph Representation Learning
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- Graph Clustering
- Link Prediction
- Graph Anomaly Detection
- Applications of Graph Machine Learning
